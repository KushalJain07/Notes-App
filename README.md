# Notes-App
A notes app with very simplistic &amp; minimalist theme I created in java with NetBeans IDE.

To start just run the NotesApp batch file, and the app will start, set a password for future references and start writing. GoodLuckðŸ˜Š

<h1>NOTE: Make sure you have java installed and added to your path. Otherwise it will not run.</h1>
